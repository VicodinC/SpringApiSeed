# Spring REST API

## Description
Java Spring/Hibernate REST API with full user authentication and token-based authorization. Build with a simple notes example, allowing users to save and edit notes on their account.

## Basic Implementation
This example contains the backbone for a basic REST API connecting to a MySQL database. User registration/login is fully implemented and a token-based endpoint authorization is fully in place as well.

## Future Plans

1. Add [Swagger](http://www.baeldung.com/swagger-2-documentation-for-spring-rest-api) implementation.
